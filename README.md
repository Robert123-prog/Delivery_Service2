A delivery company requires an application that enables customers to efficiently schedule and receive their deliveries. This system is designed to streamline current transportation methods, making them more accessible and convenient for all users involved. With this application, customers can choose the exact date and time for their package delivery, giving them greater control over their orders. The system not only improves the organization and efficiency of delivery services but also allows individuals to participate in the ecosystem as independent drivers, creating additional income opportunities.

Key Features Customer-Driven Scheduling: Customers can manually input the preferred day and time for their delivery, ensuring packages arrive at the most convenient time for them.

Choice of Transportation Methods: Customers can select their preferred transportation method based on factors like cost, estimated arrival time, package dimensions, and quantity. This flexibility allows for tailored deliveries that meet individual needs.

Open Platform for Independent Drivers: The application supports freelance work by allowing anyone to register as a driver. Drivers can make deliveries during their free time, providing them with an additional income stream while improving the companyâ€™s delivery capacity.

By implementing these features, the application aims to enhance delivery service efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and create an inclusive system that benefits both customers and the workforce.
